# coding interview introduction

## many applicants fail during
- application process: focus on experiences and things that matter. If you don't have XP, focus on side projects
- communication during interview, it's not just about the coding.

## during interview 
- you get stuck, you get wrapped up in it, you aren't even taking feedback. It's not just about getting it right or the coding, it's about the holistic approach and communication with the interviewer.
- Structured/robust problem solving process for questions you haven't heard or seen before is important.
- Being yourself: you don't want to fake it, because you would want to be yourself in the job environment.

## Advice for breaking into big tech
- practice: Get stuck and then continue working, treat it as a technical interview, you can't just stop it now and come back to it later.
- Apply as much as possible. The more interview you do, the calmer the nerves will be, and the more experienced you would be
