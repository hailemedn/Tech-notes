## Color Theory
creating the right color palette
### moods
- red - intensity, energy, love
- yellow - joy, intellect, attention (logo, headline - not for something to read for a long  time)
- Green - Freshness, safety, Growth (food)
- Blue - Stability, trust, serenity  (Finance)
- Purple - Royalty, wealth, femininity 
### combining colors
Analogous colors -> neighbors in the color palette
- Nav bar and body
- logo and logo bg
- not good at standing out tho

complementary colors -> Taking two colors from opposite ends of the color palette
- creates that pop, stand out from each other
- Don't create text and text bg with this.

## Tools 
Adobe color,  colorhunt.co
