This shit is so helpful. 
how it works on android studio is, you put a break in the code and a debugger shows you the state of the entire app at that particular line of code. it shows the values of the variables at that particular stage which i find very helpful

This is life changer if i can find it in javascript and python because it'll save me from console.loging and running everything.
