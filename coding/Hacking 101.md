# Hacking 101
- same passwords produce similar hashes.
- if you get access to the database, what you do is make a hash table comprising of commonly used passwords, dictionary words etc..
- so if a user is producing a weak password you can search for that in the hash table and you might find it.
- another option is to search for the hash online, there are many websites that produced lots of hashes for different passwords.

## strong passwords
- computers have become really powerful, so the weaker the password, the easier your account gets hacked by brute force.
- What you can do to strengthen your password is primarily to make it longer, 
- using symbols and incorporate capital letters will help but if your password is short, it will still be easy to crack.
- for example if your password is 6 characters long, it will only take basic computers like 3 min to get that password(brute force), but if you increase the length to 12 characters it will take it 31 years to brute force into your account.
- avoid using dictionary words and telephone numbers.
- you can see how long it would take for your password to be hacked using brute force of several websites, just search for password checker.
