# Declarative vs imperative programming
## Declarative
- high level abstraction,
- you essentially describe what needs to be done, then the system can figure out out to achieve the instruction.

```jsx
<h1 style={{textDecoration: "strikethrough"}}> Hello world </h1>
```

## imperative 
- low level abstraction
- you must dictate the process to achieve the goal.

```jsx
document.getElementById("root").style.textDecoration = "line-through"
```
