# React Intro
- React is a frontend library (not a framework), that is used to build frontend UI using components.
- best for rendering UI's that have similar elements with different contents (like cards of shopping items with prices, pictures and description).
- using react we will only render items needed as we scroll into them.
- react is always listening for a change in a component, so if there's any change in a component it re renders that components and leave the rest.
- it does that by comparing the old and new dom

- then it only re-renders that component.
