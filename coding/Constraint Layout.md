# Constraint Layout

I'm currently learning the android developer fundamentals course on Udemy, curtesy of our Gov't. 

It seems like we will be using relative layouts and linear layouts in this course. but the current default when using android studio is constraint layout. 

Here's the link to learn more: https://developer.android.com/studio/write/layout-editor.html
