# Cookies and Sessions
 
cookies are pieces of information that a server stores on our browser to remember our activities, so that we can resume later.
 
a good example is adding an item into a cart on amazon and using other services and coming back to amazon to find you item still in the cart.

there are different kind of cookies but we are going to focus on cookies that are used to create and maintain a session.

a session is a period of time a browser interact with a server.

when you login to a website a session starts and cookie is created

the cookie contains your user credential that says this user is logged in and authenticated.

so when you access different pages that require authentication you don't have to re login again and again because the website can check against that active cookie.

when you log out the session ends and the cookie is destroyed.
