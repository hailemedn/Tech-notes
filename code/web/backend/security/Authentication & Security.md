# Authentication & Security
## Why Authenticate
- a user generates data by using a website (liking a post, messaging etc.). in order to link this user generated data to a certain individual we need to create an account, now that certain individual can login to his account by using username and password.==so in this case we authenticate so that others don't have access (viewing) to the private user generated data (like messages).== 
- restrict access based on the status of the user
	- a user that hasn't subscribed to spotify, won't be able to use premium features
