# JavaScript Intro
was called LiveScript
Very different from Java
- it's like car and carpet
- Java is compiled, JS is interpreted.

### side note
"Hello"
- double quotes can be different on code editors and word processors
- sometimes copied text with "" from word processors might show up as an error.
## Data types
String
Number
Boolean

`// prints out the data type`
`typeOf()

`// asks user for input, shows up like an alert`
`prompt('What is your name?');`


### side note
` ctrl + k`
clears the console but will keep assigned vars,
you have to clear out cache to the clear the vars.
