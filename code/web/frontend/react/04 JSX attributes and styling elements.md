# JSX attributes and styling elements
- jsx attributes are written in camel case, pretty much just change attributes written in small case to camel case and they will work.

```jsx
<h1 className="heading"></h1>
```

- for images we can use src attribute to add a variable as a source for the image.
```jsx
<img src= {img}  />
```

- in html we can use the above code without the forward slash, but in jsx it will show an error. we have to add the forward slash
