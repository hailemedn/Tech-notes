# Create a react app
I tried using `npx create-react-app my-app` but it's not working. Online they are saying that create-react-app is depreciated.

what worked is installing the app with vite.

## steps
```sh
$ npm create vite@latest test -- --template react
$ cd test
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
