# file based resource names error

## error
=='W' is not a valid file-based resource name character: File-based resource names must contain only lowercase a-z, 0-9, or underscore==.

This error came when i try running an android studio app and the picture i was trying to use had a filename Wallpaper.jpg. 
## solution
We can't use Capital letters for file based resources.
so renaming the filename to wallpaper.jpg removed the error.
