# linux mint not booting after successful installation

the error says you have no OS installed on your PC on boot up, after i installed it successfully.

seems like this problem is related to hp old pc's
## tried
installing the OS again. but still the problem persists. 
when you try to install the OS again, it tells you, you already have linux mint OS installed.

## resource that worked, with a little tweak.

in this YouTube video, the dude give you a link to a Reddit post, where you have to copy paste some instruction so that your PC finds the OS and boots from there.

there are two links in the Reddit post, i copied the first one and it worked fine.
